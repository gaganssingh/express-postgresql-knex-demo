### Express, PostgreSQL, and Knex Demo

This is a demo server made using Expressjs, with PostgreSQL as the database, and Knex as the query builder for interacting with the database. You may also switch over to `sqlite3` as the development database by uncommenting the development section for sqlite3 in `./knexfile.js` and commenting out the `pg` section.

- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Start up the server using `npm run dev`
